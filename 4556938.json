This topic was chosen as the focus for a RER in response to the Covid-19 pandemic and school closures, as this form of technology has been adopted as part of some countries' methods of providing continuing education during closures and disruption. As such, the overall purpose of this document is to summarise the existing research literature around messaging, so that the existing evidence can be used to inform ongoing responses to the pandemic. The findings are intended to be of use to educational decision makers, including donors and those in government and NGOs, to inform responses to the current pandemic.","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.4556938","keywords":["SMS","educational technology","LMICs","Covid-19","WhatsApp","Social media","TPD","teacher professional development","refugee education","mobile learning","text message"],"license":"CC-BY-4.0","prereserve_doi":{"doi":"10.5281/zenodo.4556938","recid":4556938},"publication_date":"2020-09-29","publication_type":"report","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"zotero://select/groups/2405685/items/XHBPFYVC","relation":"isAlternateIdentifier","resource_type":"other","scheme":"url"}],"title":"Messaging Apps, SMS, and Social Media: A Rapid Evidence Review","upload_type":"publication","version":"1.0"}
