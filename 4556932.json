The present RER has been produced in response to the novel 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19), and the resulting widespread shutdown of schools. It, therefore, highlights transferable insights that may be applicable to educational responses resulting from the limitations caused by COVID-19. Established approaches to delivering distance education have renewed salience during this period because many students cannot access schooling in a school building due to social distancing requirements. As one of the longest-serving and most accessible types of educational technology (EdTech), and one that has had some success in education delivery in an LMIC context that was affected by an epidemic, it is particularly useful to focus on radio (Barnett et al., 2018; Hallgarten, 2020). Notably, the RER aims neither to advocate nor discourage the use of radio in education in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, it provides an accessible summary of existing evidence on the topic so that educators, policy makers and donors might make informed decisions about the potential of radio in education delivery.","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.4556932","license":"CC-BY-4.0","prereserve_doi":{"doi":"10.5281/zenodo.4556932","recid":4556932},"publication_date":"2021-01-28","publication_type":"report","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"zotero://select/groups/2405685/items/YMWE6FR6","relation":"isAlternateIdentifier","resource_type":"other","scheme":"url"}],"title":"Radio: A Rapid Evidence Review","upload_type":"publication"}
