The RER has been produced in response to the novel 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19), and the resulting widespread global shutdown of schools. It therefore has an emphasis on transferable insights that may be applicable to educational responses resulting from the limitations to the continuation of schooling caused by COVID-19. Established approaches to maintaining continuity of education for the most marginalised have particular salience during this period because of the significant increase in the number of students at risk of disruption. Research consistently shows that while education across the board is negatively affected by crisis situations, the schooling of girls is disproportionately impacted. The RER aims neither to advocate nor discourage the use of technology in girls' education in response to the present COVID-19 pandemic, but rather to provide an accessible summary of existing evidence on the topic so that educators, policy makers and donors might make informed decisions about the potential role of technology in delivering education for girls.","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.4556939","license":"CC-BY-4.0","prereserve_doi":{"doi":"10.5281/zenodo.4556939","recid":4556939},"publication_date":"2021-01-28","publication_type":"report","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"zotero://select/groups/2405685/items/CZBRW85R","relation":"isAlternateIdentifier","resource_type":"other","scheme":"url"}],"title":"Girls' Education and EdTech: A Rapid Evidence Review","upload_type":"publication"}
